            So how do I bring all of this to a digital space? While my
            experience with current music apps had been soured, it had not
            driven me off completely. I wanted the convenience of having all my
            music with me, just with the added comforts and joys of my old mix
            tapes. I began the process of designing an app that recreated the
            old charm of creating a mix tape with the modern conveniences of a
            mobile device.
          </h4>
        </div>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              “Tapes” would have a maximum length they could be. If you could
              find 100 songs that fit in the time frame, then more power to you,
              but you more than likely will find yourself having to really think
              about what makes the cut.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once a “Tape” was made, it was un-editable. There may be some
              wiggle room for “copying tapes” or adding to it if there was still
              “room” on the tape but even those were taboo acts within the
              mixtape community so they wouldn't be immediate “need to have”
              features.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sharing a tape with a friend would have limits of some kind. Maybe
              you only have a few copies to go around or perhaps some type of
              collateral would be required; akin to the idea of “trading tapes.”
            </li>
            <li>
              There must be some type of customization feature. Tape color,
              stickers, markers, etc. Labeling tapes will be a must but also
              some type of “skins” feature would be a fantastic perk.

          <h4>
            With MixTape, I feel I have rekindled my excitement for mixing and
            sharing music again. Where other apps had started to let me down,
            this one has made me confident we can recapture some of what has
            been loss in the move to digital. The evolution of music consumption
            has definitely lead to necessary and ingenious innovations and
            changes. Its all the more impressive for an industry that has some
            bad habits it infamously has trouble shaking. But I think we may
            have lost a little too much in this particular part of the
            community, the part where we share what we like and help provide
            context to others so they can hear songs the same way we do.
            MixTape, with its tape creation features and a unique sharing
            experience, can get us back there.
