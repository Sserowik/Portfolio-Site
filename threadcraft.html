            I wanted to create a place for people to celebrate themselves. No
            matter what you're into or what your body may look like, threadCraft
            would be a place where you could shop. I often have found that
            “nicer” clothes never fit me quite right, and they definitely fail
            to express who I, as a professional and an artist, truly am. I have
            never found a place that both provides me the comfortable, clean fit
            I desire mixed with patterns and colors that emphasize my
            personality. I set out to create threadCraft to fix that.

          <h1>So, Why Nerdcore?</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>I went in this direction for 2 reasons-</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>
            Nerdcore is one of the most flexible, inviting genres I grew up
            with. From middle aged rappers creating flows about the Atari 2600
            to young kids landing hooks about Disney Princesses, it welcomes all
            types.
          </h5>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>
            The overarching style is one that not many highend clothing products
            lean into while remaining accesible. You can easily find expensive
            and fun Nerdcore inspired clothing, but- more often than not- its
            not something made for everyBODY.
          </h5>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>
            I think due to the flowing nature of the genre and the flexibility
            of the concepts, creators don't want to try and put certain elements
            in stone- color, fonts, language, etc.- unless they can massmarket
            the final product. I believe, however, that there is a way to
            utilize the concepts present in the genre, remaining open to changes
            in the specifics as time passes, while still being accessible to
            all. Colors and fonts we use today may well need an update tomorrow,
            just stay true to the main principles.

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>
            Both the sizing available and styling would be something users were
            struggling to find in physical locations, whether it was due to time
            constraints or availability. More and more people are shopping on
            their down time- the commute to work, lunch breaks, lying in bed- so
            the app would need to accommodate users who could not make it to a
            physical location. In addition, a lot of upcoming professionals are
            also finding it harder and harder to afford the nicer clothes they
            desire, so it would be key to offer a sales selection. These
            constraints generated 3 user stories for me to lean into during this
            initial design process-

            I used the low-fidelity screens to conduct some initial rounds of
            testing. I wanted to know what users would be looking for, what was
            I missing. If I was going to promise a unique experience in product
            and sizing, what would users actually want to see?
          </h4>

            I discovered two major additions I should be focused on- more
            screens to help users find AND save their preferred fit, as well as
            an account page to tie it all together. As I created my mid fidelity
            frames, I added the following-

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>
            I also found that the sizing and tag screens helped users feel more
            confident in other areas- they felt it was going to make future
            purchases even quicker and easier, a goal I had in mind, and they
            felt more in control of their search filtering which spoke directly
            back to one of my user stories.
